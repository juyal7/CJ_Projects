As I continue my journey with Python, I’ve recently learned about virtual environments (v-env) the best for managing project dependencies!

For anyone who is new to Python, here is why virtual environments are essential:

==>Isolation: They allow you to create isolated spaces for your projects, ensuring that each project’s dependencies don’t interfere with one another.

==>Dependency Management: With venv, you can install libraries specific to a project, keeping your global Python environment clean.

==>Reproducibility: Share your projects with others without worrying about version conflicts. Simply generate a requirements.txt file and they can set up the same environment. 

Steps to create a virtual environment:
==>Run: python3 -m venv myenv
==>Activate it:
 -- Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
 -- Mac/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
==>Install dependencies using pip and get to coding
