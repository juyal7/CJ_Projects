Alternative Options and Why Matplotlib is Better Here:

Seaborn :

While good for statistical plots

Less flexible for custom dashboard layouts

Limited control over multi-plot arrangements

Plotly :

Interactive but more complex

Heavier resource usage

May be overkill for static dashboards

Bokeh :

Web-focused

More complicated setup

Not as straightforward for simple dashboards

Altair :

Declarative approach

Less suitable for complex layouts

Limited customization options

Benefits of Using Matplotlib in This Context:

Control :
